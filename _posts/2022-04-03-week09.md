title: Week 9 - Group Project Reflection

## Group Project Reflection
Our goal from the first week was to install Appsmith onto our local machines and choose an issue that we want to contribute to, as well as learn about what we need to do to fix that issue. Setting up our developer environments proved to be more difficult than we thought - when skimming the installation instructions during our first meeting, it seemed that we would need some time to figure out how to set it up, and although the instructions seemed pretty clear and the creators of Appsmith included video instructions, we still ran into some issues. There are two developer environments that we had to install, client and server, and we had issues in setting up both. However, we did get approved to work on an [issue](https://github.com/appsmithorg/appsmith/issues/7511) and plan to start working on that as a group. Our next steps are to troubleshoot setting up our development environment as a team, as we are all experiencing issues and we plan to introduce ourselves in the Appsmith discord and reach out to the team.
